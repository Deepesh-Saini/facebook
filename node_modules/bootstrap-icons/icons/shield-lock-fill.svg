Joins two paths/URLs.
 *
 * @param aRoot The root path or URL.
 * @param aPath The path or URL to be joined with the root.
 *
 * - If aPath is a URL or a data URI, aPath is returned, unless aPath is a
 *   scheme-relative URL: Then the scheme of aRoot, if any, is prepended
 *   first.
 * - Otherwise aPath is a path. If aRoot is a URL, then its path portion
 *   is updated with the result and aRoot is returned. Otherwise the result
 *   is returned.
 *   - If aPath is absolute, the result is aPath.
 *   - Otherwise the two paths are joined with a slash.
 * - Joining for example 'http://' and 'www.example.com' is also supported.
